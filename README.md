# Split Bill App

## Description
This project was developed as part of a study purpose to create an application to facilitate splitting bills at restaurants among friends. The app consists of a single screen, as demonstrated in the recorded lesson video - Part 2.

## Features
1. **Division of Bill Amount**: Currently, the application divides the total bill amount by the number of people.
2. **Icon**: The app already has an icon.
3. **Share Final Amount**: Allows sharing of the final calculated amount.
4. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: The calculated amount is spoken using TTS.
5. **Automatic Calculation**: The user does not need to click to calculate; it automatically calculates after filling in the fields for the bill amount and the number of people.
